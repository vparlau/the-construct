# Pixel Art / 8‑bit or 16‑bit Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, created in a classic pixel art style. Design the image on a square canvas divided into a visible pixel grid. Simplify forms into blocky shapes and use a limited colour palette defined below. Apply shading through flat colours or dithering techniques to imply depth, keeping details clear at small scales. Choose the pixel resolution (e.g., 8‑bit or 16‑bit) to control granularity. Keep the background uncomplicated with solid colours or simple patterns to avoid clutter. Finish with crisp, hard edges and no anti‑aliasing to preserve the retro game aesthetic.
