# Low‑Poly / Geometric Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, represented in a low‑poly or geometric design. Compose the piece in a square format, centring the subject while constructing it from faceted polygons and angular shapes. Use flat shading or simple gradients on each face to emphasise the geometry. Choose a coherent colour palette to accentuate the forms and avoid realistic textures. Adjust polygon count to control the level of abstraction. Select a background style—plain or with geometric patterns—that supports the aesthetic without overwhelming it. Finish with crisp edges and sharp transitions to highlight the faceted structure.

# Config:
polygon_count    = "<e.g., very low, low, medium>"
colour_palette   = "<e.g., complementary colours, analogous hues, monochrome>"
shading_style    = "<e.g., flat shading, soft gradient, cel‑shaded>"
lighting_style   = "<e.g., uniform ambient, directional light, rim light>"
geometric_style = "<e.g., angular facets, rounded polyhedra, mixed shapes>"
background_style = "<e.g., solid colour, polygon pattern, gradient>"
