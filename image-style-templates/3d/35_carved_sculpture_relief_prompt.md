# Carved Sculpture / Relief Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted as a carved sculpture or relief. Arrange the portrait within a square frame, imagining the subject chiseled from stone, wood, or cast in bronze. Use the chosen material below to determine the surface finish and colour. Indicate carving depth—bas‑relief, high relief, or full three‑dimensional form—to control how much the subject projects from the background. Show tool marks or polished smoothness according to the desired texture. Illuminate the piece with light angled from the side or above to emphasise shadows and highlights on the carved surfaces. Finish with a dignified or timeless mood that reflects sculptural art.
