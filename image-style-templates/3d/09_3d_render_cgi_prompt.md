# Stylised 3D Render / CGI Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, visualised as a stylised 3D render. Frame the scene in a square format with the subject centred and facing forward. Model the character and props with clean geometry and stylised proportions, avoiding full photorealism. Select materials (plastic, matte, metallic, etc.) and a colour palette appropriate to the mood. Illuminate the scene using a three‑point or dramatic lighting setup defined below to create appealing highlights and shadows. Apply a chosen rendering style, such as toon shading or semi‑realistic shading, to control the look of surfaces. Keep the background simple or subtly detailed so it doesn’t compete with the subject. Finish with post‑processing like bloom, depth‑of‑field blur, or ambient occlusion as specified.

# Config:

lighting_setup    = "<e.g., three‑point, rim lighting, dramatic spotlight>"
detail_level      = "<e.g., simple, moderate, intricate>"
background_style  = "<e.g., plain colour, gradient, soft environment>"
post_effects      = "<e.g., none, bloom, depth of field, ambient occlusion>"
