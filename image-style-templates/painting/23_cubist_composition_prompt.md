# Cubist Composition Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, reinterpreted through a Cubist lens. Construct the portrait as a square composition, breaking the subject into geometric planes and facets that show multiple angles simultaneously. Use overlapping shapes and angular fragments to deconstruct forms while maintaining recognisable features. Choose a restrained colour palette—often earthy or muted—with occasional contrasting accents. Arrange the fragments in a dynamic yet balanced manner, incorporating background collage elements if desired. Finish with visible brush strokes or textured surfaces to evoke early Cubist paintings.

# Config:

shape_style         = "<e.g., angular, curved facets, mixed>"
background_collage  = "<e.g., plain, geometric patterns, newspaper clippings>"
texture_presence    = "<e.g., smooth, subtle texture, heavy texture>"
