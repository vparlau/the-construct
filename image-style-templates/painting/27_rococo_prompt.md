# Rococo Elegance Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted with the playful luxury of Rococo art. Compose the square image with the subject gracefully positioned and surrounded by ornate, swirling motifs like shells, florals, and garlands. Use a light, pastel colour palette with soft pinks, blues, creams, and gilded accents. Emphasise delicate curves and intricate detailing in both the subject’s attire and the environment. Incorporate whimsical elements such as cherubs or flowing ribbons if desired. Finish with gentle lighting and a refined yet lively mood that reflects the exuberance of the Rococo period.
