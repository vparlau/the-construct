# Gothic / Baroque Ornamentation Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered in a Gothic or Baroque aesthetic. Frame the portrait as a square with the subject centred amid dark, opulent surroundings. Incorporate ornate architectural or decorative elements—arches, columns, intricate carvings—that evoke cathedrals or palatial interiors. Use a rich, deep colour palette accented with metallic golds or silvers. Employ dramatic lighting and strong contrasts to emphasise depth and shadow. Allow textures such as stone, velvet, or lace to show prominently. Finish with lavish detail and a mysterious or grand mood characteristic of Gothic and Baroque art.
