# Futurist Dynamics Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted in the energetic style of Futurism. Compose the square image with the subject centred but portrayed in motion—using repeated outlines, blurring, or fragmented forms to convey speed and dynamism. Incorporate mechanical or industrial motifs, such as gears or abstract shapes, to emphasise modernity and progress. Select a metallic or high‑contrast colour palette with bright highlights and deep shadows. Experiment with diagonal compositions and sweeping lines to guide the eye and suggest acceleration. Finish with rhythmic repetition and overlapping elements that capture the sensation of motion.

# Config:
motion_effect       = "<e.g., multiple exposure, motion blur, streaking lines>"
colour_palette      = "<e.g., metallic greys with flashes of red, warm copper tones, cool chromes>"
subject_duplication = "<e.g., none, subtle repetition, pronounced duplication>"
perspective_type    = "<e.g., tilted, dynamic diagonal, straight on>"
energy_level        = "<e.g., moderate, high, intense>"
industrial_motifs   = "<e.g., gears, machinery, abstract mechanical shapes>"
background_style    = "<e.g., simple gradient, abstract speed lines, geometric patterns>"
