# Watercolor Painting Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered with transparent watercolor techniques. Compose the image as a square with the subject facing forward and centred. Use fluid washes and soft edges to build form, allowing colours to blend naturally on the paper. Layer multiple translucent washes to achieve depth, leaving white spaces for highlights. Avoid harsh outlines; suggest contours with subtle changes in tone. Choose a harmonious colour palette that suits the mood and let the texture of the paper contribute to the overall look. Finish with delicate details and controlled bleeds that capture the spontaneity of watercolor.
