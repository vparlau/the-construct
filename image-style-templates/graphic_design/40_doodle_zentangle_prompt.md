# Doodle / Zentangle Pattern Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, transformed into an intricate doodle or zentangle composition. Arrange the square canvas with the subject at the centre, but fill the surrounding space—and/or the interior of the subject—with repetitive patterns, motifs, and whimsical shapes. Use flowing lines and varied motifs—geometric shapes, organic forms, and abstract patterns—as defined below. Choose a colour palette, often monochrome or limited hues, to maintain cohesion. Adjust pattern density to control visual complexity. Finish with a playful, meditative feel that showcases the art of detailed doodling.

# Config:
pattern_density   = "<e.g., sparse, moderate, dense>"
motif_types       = "<e.g., geometric shapes, floral patterns, abstract swirls>"
line_thickness    = "<e.g., fine, medium, varied>"
colour_palette    = "<e.g., black and white, limited colours, rainbow>"
fill_style        = "<e.g., simple outlines, filled patterns, negative space patterns>"
mood              = "<e.g., playful, calming, chaotic>"
