# Etching / Engraving Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered as an etching or engraved illustration. Construct the image on a square canvas using fine, precise lines and intricate cross‑hatching to build form and shading. Choose a plate tone—black and white or sepia—and let the paper texture show through. Include delicate decorative borders if desired. Control the density of lines to achieve depth and contrast. Avoid large flat areas of colour; rely on hatching and stippling instead. Finish with an antique, technical, or refined mood consistent with historical engravings.
