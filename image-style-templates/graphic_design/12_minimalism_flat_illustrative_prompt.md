# Minimalism / Flat Illustrative Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted using a minimalist, flat‑illustration approach. Compose the scene as a square with ample negative space, positioning the subject simply and clearly. Construct forms from basic shapes and clean lines, removing unnecessary detail. Use a limited colour palette with harmonious hues and few shades. Avoid gradients or textures unless specified; rely instead on flat areas of colour to define shapes. Maintain a calm, balanced composition with attention to proportions and spacing. Finish with a crisp, modern look that communicates the essence of the subject through minimal elements.
