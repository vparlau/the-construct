# Glitch/Abstract Digital Art Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, expressed as glitch or abstract digital art. Construct the composition on a square canvas using fragmented shapes, pixel distortions, and unexpected color shifts to evoke a sense of digital disruption. Manipulate the image with layering, data‑mashing effects, or geometric patterns that break the subject into abstract forms. Choose a palette that reflects the desired mood—neon synth colours, subdued monochrome, or iridescent gradients—and vary saturation across the piece. Consider introducing noise, scan lines, or visual artefacts to simulate corrupted data. Keep the background integrated into the glitch effects, creating a cohesive yet chaotic aesthetic. Balance randomness with intentional design to convey both disorder and artistry.

# Config:
glitch_intensity  = "<e.g., mild pixelate, moderate distortion, extreme fragmentation>"
colour_palette    = "<e.g., neon RGB, dark monochrome, pastel glitch>"
texture_complexity= "<e.g., smooth gradients, layered noise, heavy artefacts>"
pattern_geometry  = "<e.g., squares and rectangles, hexagonal shapes, irregular shards>"
noise_effect      = "<e.g., none, subtle grain, heavy static>"
background_blend  = "<e.g., fully integrated, partial separation, contrasting color field>"
mood              = "<e.g., chaotic, futuristic, dreamlike>"
overlay_elements  = "<e.g., circuit diagrams, random code, none>"
