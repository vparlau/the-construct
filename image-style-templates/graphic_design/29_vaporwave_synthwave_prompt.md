# Vaporwave / Synthwave Retro Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered in a vaporwave or synthwave aesthetic. Frame the image as a square with the subject centred against a backdrop of retro digital motifs. Use a vibrant colour palette dominated by neon pinks, purples, blues, and teals. Incorporate iconic elements such as sunset gradients, gridlines, palm trees, retro computer graphics, or classical statues. Apply soft glows, lens flares, and CRT‑style scanlines to evoke nostalgia. Keep compositions simple but evocative, balancing surreal atmosphere with retro futurist charm. Finish with an overall dreamy, nostalgic mood.
