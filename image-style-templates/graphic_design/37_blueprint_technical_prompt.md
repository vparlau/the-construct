# Blueprint / Technical Drawing Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, presented as a blueprint or technical drawing. Frame the subject within a square canvas using precise, thin lines and schematic conventions. Use a dark or coloured background (often blue) with contrasting line work in white or light colours. Include annotations, dimension lines, and labels if needed, adhering to technical drafting standards. Choose the scale and level of detail below. Keep shading minimal; rely on line weight and hatching to convey depth. Finish with a clean, engineered aesthetic that emphasises precision and clarity.

# Config:
line_colour        = "<e.g., white, pale blue, light grey>"
background_colour  = "<e.g., dark blue, navy, charcoal>"
scale_detail       = "<e.g., simplified outline, moderate detail, highly detailed>"
annotation_presence= "<e.g., none, minimal labels, full annotations>"
dimension_lines    = "<e.g., hidden, selective, comprehensive>"
mood               = "<e.g., industrial, futuristic, educational>"
