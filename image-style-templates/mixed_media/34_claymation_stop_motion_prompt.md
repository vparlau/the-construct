# Claymation / Stop‑Motion Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, imagined as a claymation or stop‑motion figure. Compose the square image with the subject centred, sculpted from clay or similar materials. Show hand‑crafted textures, including fingerprints or tool marks, on the model’s surface. Use bold, saturated colours or natural clay tones according to the chosen palette. Pose the figure in a way that conveys character and movement. Select a handmade background or simple set appropriate to the scene. Finish with studio or natural lighting that enhances the tactile qualities, and optionally include small imperfections to reinforce the stop‑motion aesthetic.
