# Collage / Mixed Media Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, assembled as a collage or mixed‑media artwork. Use a square composition, layering photographic fragments, drawn elements, and textured materials to form the image. Combine different media sources—magazine cut‑outs, fabric swatches, hand‑drawn sketches—defined below, blending or juxtaposing them to create an eclectic yet coherent piece. Employ varying opacities and overlapping shapes to build depth. Choose a colour palette that ties disparate pieces together. Allow edges to remain torn or irregular if desired, and integrate background textures that enhance the sense of handcrafted assembly. Finish with a cohesive arrangement that balances chaos and harmony.
