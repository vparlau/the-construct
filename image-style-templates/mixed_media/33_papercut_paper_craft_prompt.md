# Papercut / Paper Craft Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, crafted as a layered papercut artwork. Design the square composition by cutting shapes from coloured paper and stacking them to form the subject and background. Specify the number of layers and edge treatment below. Use a limited palette for cohesion, with contrasting hues to distinguish different layers. Cast subtle shadows between layers to create depth and dimension. Choose the paper texture that influences the final look. Finish with clean or torn edges and a balanced arrangement that highlights the handcrafted nature of paper craft.
