# Mosaic / Stained Glass Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, represented as a mosaic or stained‑glass artwork. Compose the image within a square frame, constructing the subject from individual coloured tiles or pieces of glass separated by grout or lead lines. Choose a material type and tile size below to control the level of detail and texture. Use a harmonious colour palette to create patterns or figurative scenes. Allow light to interact with translucent pieces if it’s stained glass, or incorporate reflective qualities for ceramic mosaics. Finish with a deliberate arrangement of shapes and colours that evokes traditional mosaic or stained‑glass craftsmanship.
