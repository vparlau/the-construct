# Concept Art / Matte Painting Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered as concept art or a matte painting. Compose the piece in a square format, placing the subject prominently while leaving room for environmental context. Use dynamic perspective and atmospheric depth to establish a sense of scale. Paint with broad, expressive strokes blended with finer detailing to suggest form and texture. Choose a colour scheme that conveys the mood—dramatic, ethereal, dystopian, etc.—and apply lighting that supports the narrative. Incorporate environmental elements or abstract backgrounds as needed, defined below. Finish with layered textures and subtle atmospheric effects (haze, fog, light shafts) to evoke cinematic depth and world‑building.
