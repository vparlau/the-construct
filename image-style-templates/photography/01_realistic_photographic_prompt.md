# Realistic / Photographic Style

```
[INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE]

Ensure it is captured in a hyper‑realistic studio portrait. Compose the scene as a square, with the subject facing directly toward the camera and centered in the frame. Keep the background simple and distraction‑free, using the specified colour or texture below. Illuminate the subject with a primary key light and complementary fill lighting to create balanced highlights and natural shadows. Reproduce lifelike textures on skin, fabrics, and accessories, showcasing realistic materials and subtle wear. Apply the chosen colour grade to achieve a rich look without oversaturation, preserving fine detail. Control depth of field to keep the subject sharp while softly blurring the backdrop. Finish with precise post‑processing to deliver a polished, high‑end photographic result.
