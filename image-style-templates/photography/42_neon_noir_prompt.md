# Neon Noir Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, visualised in a neon noir aesthetic. Compose the square image with the subject centred against a moody urban backdrop lit by vibrant neon signs. Combine the high‑contrast shadows and dramatic compositions of classic noir with the saturated, glowing colours of neon lights. Use rain‑slick streets, reflective surfaces, or fog to amplify atmosphere. Choose a colour palette dominated by deep blues, purples, and pinks with occasional pops of neon green or yellow. Finish with a mysterious or melancholic mood, balancing grit and luminescence.
