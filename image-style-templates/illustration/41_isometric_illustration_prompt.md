# Isometric / 2.5D Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted in an isometric or 2.5D perspective. Design the square composition with the subject rendered using parallel projection, typically at a 30° or 45° angle, so there is no vanishing point. Construct forms from clean geometric shapes with consistent angles. Choose a colour palette that enhances the three‑dimensional effect while remaining cohesive. Decide on line presence and shading style below, such as flat shading or subtle gradients, to emphasise volume. Keep the grid implied or visible as desired. Finish with a tidy, structured look that evokes architectural drawings or game art.

# Config:
view_angle       = "<e.g., 30°, 45°, custom angle>"
colour_palette   = "<e.g., muted pastels, vibrant synthwave tones, monochrome>"
line_presence    = "<e.g., none, thin outlines, bold outlines>"
detail_level     = "<e.g., simple shapes, moderate detail, intricate design>"
shading_style    = "<e.g., flat colours, soft gradients, cel shading>"
grid_visible     = "<e.g., hidden, subtle, pronounced>"
