# Children's Book Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, illustrated in a children's book style. Arrange the scene on a square page with friendly characters and environments designed to engage young readers. Use simple, expressive shapes and soft lines to define figures and objects. Opt for a warm, inviting colour palette—pastels or bright primary colours—and consider hand‑drawn textures or digital painting that conveys a cosy feel. Keep backgrounds whimsical yet uncluttered, featuring imaginative landscapes or household settings. Emphasise storytelling elements, such as character interactions or actions, and maintain a lighthearted mood throughout. Ensure the overall composition is accessible and charming, appealing to early readers.
