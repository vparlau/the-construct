# Western Cartoon / Comic Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered in a Western cartoon or comic‑book portrait. Compose the image as a square with the character facing forward and centred. Use bold outlines with consistent line thickness and exaggerated features that convey personality. Colour the piece using flat or lightly gradient fills in a high‑contrast, saturated palette defined below. Apply simple shading sparingly—through flat shadows or cross‑hatching—to suggest form without photorealism. Select a background colour or pattern that complements the subject and supports the narrative. Keep textures minimal to preserve the graphic, illustrative quality. Finish with clean digital lines and colours to emulate contemporary comic art.
