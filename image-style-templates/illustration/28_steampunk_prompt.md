# Steampunk Fantasy Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, envisioned in a steampunk fantasy setting. Arrange the square composition with the subject centred, adorned in Victorian‑inspired attire combined with imaginative mechanical contraptions. Incorporate gears, cogs, pipes, and steam‑powered devices into clothing, accessories, or background elements. Use a warm, sepia‑toned colour palette with brass, copper, and leather textures. Apply lighting that feels industrial—glowing bulbs, diffused steam—or warm and antique. Finish with intricate detailing and a sense of adventure and invention characteristic of steampunk worlds.
