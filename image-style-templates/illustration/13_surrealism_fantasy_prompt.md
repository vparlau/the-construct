# Surrealism / Fantasy Realism Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, transformed into a surreal or fantastical scene. Use a square composition, centering the main subject while integrating unexpected, dreamlike elements around them. Render the subject and key objects with a high degree of realism, but juxtapose them with imaginative or impossible features—floating objects, unusual scales, or hybrid creatures—defined below. Choose a colour palette and lighting scheme that enhance the otherworldly mood. Manipulate perspective and proportions subtly to disorient the viewer while keeping the overall scene coherent. Finish with meticulous detail and atmospheric effects to blend the real and the fantastical seamlessly.

# Config:

lighting_style     = "<e.g., soft ethereal, high‑contrast dramatic, coloured lights>"
distortion_level   = "<e.g., subtle, moderate, extreme>"
