# Art Nouveau Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, illustrated in the flowing, decorative Art Nouveau style. Frame the portrait as a square, centring the subject and surrounding them with organic, curving lines and natural motifs. Use elegant, sinuous outlines to define forms, integrating floral patterns, vines, or other nature‑inspired elements. Choose a soft, harmonious colour palette often featuring muted pastels, creams, and golds. Incorporate ornamental borders or frames that complement the composition. Finish with intricate detailing and an overall sense of graceful movement characteristic of Art Nouveau.
