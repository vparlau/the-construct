# Sci‑Fi Concept Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, envisioned as a science‑fiction concept illustration distinct from cyberpunk. Create the square composition with the subject set against a futuristic backdrop—alien landscapes, advanced spacecraft interiors, or sprawling space stations. Use sleek, cutting‑edge designs or organic extraterrestrial forms. Choose a colour palette featuring cool metallics, cosmic hues, or luminescent accents. Apply imaginative lighting effects like bioluminescent glow, starlight, or energy beams. Incorporate advanced technology such as robots, holograms, or exosuits as defined below. Finish with a sense of wonder or isolation characteristic of sci‑fi worlds beyond Earth.
