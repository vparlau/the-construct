# Fashion Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted as a fashion illustration. Compose the subject on a square canvas, focusing on fluid lines and dynamic poses that emphasise garment shape and movement. Use elongated proportions and stylised figures to showcase clothing design rather than anatomical realism. Select a background that is minimal or lightly textured, keeping attention on the outfit. Choose a colour palette that complements the fashion theme—whether it’s bold haute couture hues or soft pastels—and apply textures to suggest fabric types like silk, denim, or leather. Add expressive brush strokes or line accents to capture motion and drape. Maintain a polished yet artistic mood suited to editorial or runway presentation.
