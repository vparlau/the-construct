# Digital Illustration / Painterly Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, portrayed as a richly rendered digital illustration. Compose the artwork as a square with the subject centred and facing forward. Use expressive digital brush strokes and layered colours to create a painterly feel, blending hues smoothly while retaining visible texture. Choose a colour palette that suits the mood and emphasise dynamic lighting to sculpt forms and convey depth. Keep the background simple or painterly, as defined below, so it supports rather than distracts from the subject. Finish with careful detailing and soft edges to achieve a cohesive, digitally painted look.
