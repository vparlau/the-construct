# Anime / Manga Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, illustrated in a stylised anime or manga portrait. Use a square composition with the character facing forward and centred within the frame. Draw clean, deliberate line art with controlled line weight to emphasise expressive facial features and stylised proportions (large eyes, small nose and mouth). Colour the image using the specified palette, employing flat or cell shading with subtle gradients to define volume. Keep the background simple or pastel, as defined below, to prevent distraction. Maintain smooth surfaces without realistic textures, and preserve the hand‑drawn feel. Finish with minimal post‑processing so the image retains an authentic anime aesthetic.
