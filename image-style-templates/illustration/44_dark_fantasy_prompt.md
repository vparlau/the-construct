# Dark Fantasy Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, reimagined within a dark fantasy setting. Design the square composition with the subject placed in a brooding, ominous environment—crumbling ruins, foggy forests, or shadowed caverns. Use a muted or desaturated colour palette with deep blacks, greys, and browns contrasted by occasional eerie glows. Incorporate sinister creatures, worn armour, or occult symbols as appropriate. Apply dramatic, low‑key lighting such as moonlight or flickering torches to heighten mood. Control the level of graphic content according to preference. Finish with a foreboding and atmospheric tone that evokes the tension and beauty of dark fantasy.
