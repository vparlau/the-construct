# catalogs/ — Machine Index (Optional)

This directory can hold machine-generated catalogs for tools and scripts. Humans can ignore it.

- **`CATALOG.json`** consolidates artifacts across domains by scanning YAML front‑matter.
- Generation runs **outside** this no‑code repository; commit the output only if it improves discoverability or CI usage.
- If you don’t need a machine index yet, you may keep this folder empty or remove it.

Refer to the minimal domain layout and update workflow in the main repository context.
