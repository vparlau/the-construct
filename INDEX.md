# Global Index

A human‑readable map of domains and quick links. Keep this file concise and current.

> Tip: Domains remain minimal and user‑facing. Operational internals live in `ops/`.

## Domains

| Domain | Purpose (1 line) | Maintainer | Path | Index | Usage |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| _none yet_ | Add your first domain below | — | — | — | — |

<!--
To register a domain, add a row like:
| writing | Long‑form writing, outlining, editing | maintainer-handle | writing/ | [INDEX](writing/INDEX.md) | [USAGE](writing/USAGE-GUIDE.md) |
-->

## How to keep this index fresh
- When you add a domain, add one row to the table above.
- When you rename or remove a domain, update this table immediately.
- If the table grows large, add subsections by topical group.
