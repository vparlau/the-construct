# Pop Art / Comic Pop Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, depicted in a pop art or comic‑pop aesthetic. Arrange the portrait as a square with the subject prominent and centered. Use bright, flat colours and bold outlines to evoke the look of mid‑20th‑century pop art. Incorporate halftone patterns, Ben‑Day dots or stripes into the fills and backgrounds as defined below. Apply minimal shading; rely on high contrast and flat shapes to convey form. Include optional text elements or graphic motifs that reference comic books or consumer culture. Finish with a playful, high‑energy composition that celebrates bold colour and graphic simplicity.
