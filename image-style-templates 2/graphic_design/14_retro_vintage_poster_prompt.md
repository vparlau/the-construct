# Retro / Vintage Poster Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, designed as a retro or vintage poster. Compose the artwork in a square format reminiscent of mid‑century advertising or travel posters. Use bold, simplified shapes and a restrained colour palette inspired by aged inks or faded paints. Incorporate halftone dots, distressed textures, or paper grain to evoke the printing techniques of the era. Place typography and graphic elements (if applicable) strategically to balance the composition. Employ simple, flat shading and high contrast to make the subject stand out. Finish with a weathered or worn look to enhance authenticity.
