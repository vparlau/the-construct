# Graffiti / Street Art Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, created in the bold, urban style of graffiti or street art. Compose the square image with the subject positioned prominently on an implied wall surface, using vibrant spray‑paint colours and dynamic lettering or characters. Incorporate drips, splatters, stencils, or tags to capture the raw energy of street art. Use high contrast and expressive strokes to make the image pop. Choose a textured backdrop—brick, concrete, metal—as defined below, and allow overlapping layers or collage elements for depth. Finish with a rebellious, energetic mood that reflects urban culture.
