# Propaganda / Soviet Poster Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, designed as a vintage propaganda or Soviet poster. Compose the square image with a strong, central subject and bold geometric shapes. Utilise a restricted colour scheme dominated by powerful hues like reds, blacks, and whites—or choose another limited palette as defined below. Incorporate simple yet striking imagery such as heroic figures, industrial motifs, or symbolic objects. Add concise, impactful text or slogans in a blocky sans‑serif font if appropriate. Use diagonal compositions or radiating lines to create dynamism. Finish with clean shapes, high contrast, and a sense of urgency or unity.

# Config:
colour_scheme      = "<e.g., red/black/white, blue/white/yellow, monochrome with accent>"
slogan_text        = "<e.g., optional slogan, none>"
composition_type   = "<e.g., dynamic diagonal, symmetric centred, radiating lines>"
imagery_type       = "<e.g., heroic workers, industrial machinery, symbolic icons>"
font_style         = "<e.g., bold sans‑serif, constructivist type, block lettering>"
distress_level     = "<e.g., clean modern, slightly aged, heavily distressed>"
