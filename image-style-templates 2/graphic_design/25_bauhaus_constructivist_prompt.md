# Bauhaus / Constructivist Design Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, executed in a Bauhaus or Constructivist design aesthetic. Present the subject in a square format using clean, geometric forms and a minimal composition. Employ simple shapes—rectangles, circles, lines—and a restricted palette dominated by primary colours (red, yellow, blue) along with black and white. Use a strong grid or aligned layout to organise elements, and integrate typography sparingly if appropriate. Avoid ornamental detail; focus on functional, abstract design. Finish with flat colours and crisp edges to achieve a modernist look.

# Config:
shape_composition  = "<e.g., rectangles and circles, angular lines, overlapping forms>"
colour_palette     = "<e.g., primary triad, black and white with red accent, limited duo-tone>"
type_inclusion     = "<e.g., none, minimal sans-serif text, bold typographic element>"
grid_alignment     = "<e.g., strict grid, loose alignment, dynamic diagonal>"
texture_presence   = "<e.g., none, light paper grain, subtle halftone>"
background_style   = "<e.g., solid colour, intersecting shapes, divided fields>"
