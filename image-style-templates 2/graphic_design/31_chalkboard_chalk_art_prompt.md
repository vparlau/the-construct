# Chalkboard / Chalk Art Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, illustrated in a chalkboard art aesthetic. Arrange the subject on a square, dark chalkboard background. Draw the figure and accompanying elements with chalk‑like lines and strokes, using white or coloured chalk to create contrast against the board. Allow visible chalk dust, smudges, and texture to enhance authenticity. Incorporate hand‑drawn lettering or decorative flourishes if appropriate. Keep shading simple, relying on hatching or thicker strokes rather than gradients. Finish with a playful, rustic, or educational mood that evokes hand‑rendered chalk art.
