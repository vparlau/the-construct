# Vector / Flat Design Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, created as a clean vector or flat‑design portrait. Arrange the composition as a square with the subject centred and facing forward. Construct the figure using simple geometric shapes and smooth curves, avoiding visible brush strokes or realistic textures. Employ a limited colour palette with solid fills; use subtle gradients only when specified. Keep shading minimal—rely on flat colours and occasional soft shadows to imply depth. Choose an outline style (none or thin) that matches the modern, minimalist aesthetic. Define a background colour or basic pattern that contrasts with the subject without adding complexity. Finish with crisp, scalable rendering suitable for icons, infographics or logos.

# Config:
colour_palette     = "<e.g., monochrome, triadic scheme, pastel set>"
line_presence      = "<e.g., none, thin stroke, medium stroke>"
shape_style        = "<e.g., rounded geometric, sharp angular, organic curves>"
gradient_use       = "<e.g., none, subtle, pronounced>"
background_style   = "<e.g., solid colour, two‑tone split, simple pattern>"
shadow_style       = "<e.g., none, long flat shadow, soft drop shadow>"
iconography_level  = "<e.g., high, medium, low>"
