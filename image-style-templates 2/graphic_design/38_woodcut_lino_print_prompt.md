# Woodcut / Lino Print Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, portrayed in a woodcut or lino print style. Compose the square image with bold, carved lines and strong contrasts. Simplify forms into shapes that can be carved, leaving areas of white or single colour for highlights and dark areas for shadows. Choose a palette—often black and white or limited colours—to enhance the graphic quality. Emphasise the texture of the carving: visible gouges, uneven edges, or woodgrain. Decide on line thickness and carving style below. Finish with a rustic or dramatic mood that reflects traditional printmaking.
