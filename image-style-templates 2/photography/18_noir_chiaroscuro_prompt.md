# Noir / Chiaroscuro Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, portrayed with a noir or chiaroscuro aesthetic. Frame the image as a square with the subject centered, but allow deep shadows and dramatic lighting to dominate the composition. Use a limited colour scheme, often black and white or desaturated tones, to emphasise contrast. Position a strong light source to carve the subject from darkness, casting long shadows and creating sharp edges. Introduce film grain or texture to evoke vintage photography or cinematic noir. Select background elements sparingly, keeping them dim or silhouetted. Finish with a moody atmosphere that suggests mystery and tension.
