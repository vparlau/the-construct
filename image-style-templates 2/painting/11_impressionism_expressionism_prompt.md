# Impressionism / Expressionism Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, interpreted through an impressionist or expressionist lens. Compose the image as a square with the subject centred but allow loose, gestural brush strokes to capture movement and mood rather than precise detail. Use a palette of colours that evoke the chosen emotion, blending hues on the canvas to suggest light and atmosphere. Emphasise the interplay of light and shadow without sharp outlines, and allow the background to merge with the subject in places. Visible strokes and textures convey energy and emotion. Finish with an overall painterly surface that feels spontaneous and dynamic.
