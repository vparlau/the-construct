# Traditional Painting Style (Oil / Watercolor)

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered as a traditional painting. Arrange the composition as a square with the subject centred, capturing the essence of classic media. Choose the painting medium below (oil or watercolor), then apply appropriate techniques: thick, textured brush strokes and rich, layered pigments for oils; or transparent washes and delicate bleeding edges for watercolor. Select a colour palette that reflects the chosen medium’s character, and employ traditional lighting to model form. Allow the texture of canvas or paper to show through where appropriate. Keep the background simple or impressionistic so it complements the subject. Finish with visible brushwork and authentic surface textures to evoke the feel of hand‑painted art.
