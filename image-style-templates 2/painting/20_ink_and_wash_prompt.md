# Ink and Wash Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, executed in an ink and wash technique. Present the subject within a square composition, using expressive ink lines to define form and delicate washes to create tonal variation. Select an ink style—calligraphic, bold, or fine—and apply washes of varying intensity to suggest shading, depth, or background. Choose a limited colour palette (often monochrome or muted hues) that complements the ink work. Let the texture of the paper show through, and allow brushstrokes to bleed slightly for an organic feel. Balance positive and negative space carefully, leaving areas of the page untouched to enhance contrast. Finish with a harmonious blend of line and wash that reflects traditional East Asian or Western ink painting.
