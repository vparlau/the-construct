# Medical Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered in a medical illustration style. Depict the subject with clinical precision on a square canvas, focusing on anatomical accuracy and clear visual communication. Use crisp line work and smooth shading to reveal form and internal structures, such as muscles, organs, or cellular layers. Employ a neutral or white background to maintain focus and avoid distractions. Apply a colour scheme that enhances clarity—often subtle pastels or colour‑coded tints—and label key parts with precise typography if desired. Maintain a clean, informative composition that balances scientific detail with visual aesthetics.

# Config:
anatomical_focus   = "<e.g., skeletal system, muscular anatomy, cellular cross‑section>"

background_type    = "<e.g., plain white, light gradient, sterile operating room>"
annotation_style   = "<e.g., none, labeled parts, callouts with descriptions>"
shading_level      = "<e.g., flat diagrams, moderate shading, fully rendered 3D>"
perspective        = "<e.g., frontal, lateral, isometric>"
mood               = "<e.g., educational, clinical, illustrative>"
