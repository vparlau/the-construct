# Botanical Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, rendered as a scientific or botanical illustration. Arrange the square composition with the subject centred and clearly isolated on a neutral background. Depict plants, flowers, or botanical elements with meticulous accuracy and fine line work. Use naturalistic colours and careful shading to convey structure and texture. Include details such as roots, stems, leaves, and flowers, possibly adding annotations or labels for educational context. Keep the background minimal to highlight the specimen. Finish with a precise, elegant look that balances scientific fidelity and artistic beauty.
