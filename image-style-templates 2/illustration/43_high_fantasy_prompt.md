# High Fantasy Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, brought to life in a high fantasy illustration. Compose the square artwork with the subject heroic or mythical in nature, situated within a grand, epic environment such as towering mountains, ancient castles, or enchanted forests. Use rich, saturated colours and intricate detailing on costumes, armour, and creatures. Illuminate the scene with dramatic lighting—golden sunlight, glowing magic, or ethereal beams. Incorporate fantastical elements like dragons, mystical creatures, or elaborate weaponry as appropriate. Finish with an adventurous and majestic mood that captures the wonder of high fantasy worlds.
