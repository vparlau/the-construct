# Sketch / Pencil Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, drawn as a traditional pencil sketch. Compose the portrait in a square format with the subject centred and facing the viewer. Use confident, visible lines with varied weight and expressive strokes to define form. Build shading through hatching and cross‑hatching instead of smooth gradients, leaving some construction or gestural lines to enhance the sketch aesthetic. Apply the chosen tonal palette (e.g., grayscale or sepia) and optionally add subtle paper texture. Keep the background minimal—use negative space or a light vignette—to frame the subject. Avoid digital colouring; preserve the raw, hand‑drawn quality of the sketch.

# Config:
paper_texture      = "<e.g., smooth, rough sketchbook, aged parchment>"
line_weight        = "<e.g., uniform, varied, light with occasional heavy accents>"
shading_density    = "<e.g., light, moderate, heavy>"
tone               = "<e.g., black and white, grayscale, warm sepia>"
background_detail  = "<e.g., blank, light vignette, simple shapes>"
gesture_visibility= "<e.g., none, subtle, prominent>"
border_style       = "<e.g., none, rough torn edges, clean border>"
