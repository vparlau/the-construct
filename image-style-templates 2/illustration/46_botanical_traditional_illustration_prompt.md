# Botanical Illustration Style

```
{SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, illustrated in a traditional botanical style. Render the subject with scientific accuracy and aesthetic elegance on a square canvas. Use fine lines and precise shading to depict plant structures—leaves, stems, flowers—while maintaining clarity and realism. Choose an illustration medium, such as watercolor with delicate washes or pen and ink with cross‑hatching. Select a natural colour palette that reflects true plant hues. Optionally include annotations or field notes in a handwritten style. Keep backgrounds minimal or softly shaded to emphasise the specimen. Finish with a calm, informative mood that balances art and science.
